## Style Guidelines:

- The dark color scheme should align with the modern aesthetic and content-heavy user interface described by the prompt. The primary color will be a vibrant orange (#FFA500) suggesting a burst of creative energy and excitement in talent discovery.
- The background color will be a dark gray (#282828), desaturated, to create a comfortable contrast and focus attention on the content.
- Accent color: A shade of purple (#800080). This will be reserved for less prominent UI elements like toggle controls, progress meters, tooltips and guidance, to call attention to the elements without causing distraction.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif), for headlines and short chunks of text; Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif), if longer text is anticipated, choose 'Alegreya' for body text.
- Use minimalist, custom icons that align with each function or category. Focused use of negative space in iconography would contribute to a polished and uncluttered UX.
- Prioritize a clean, intuitive layout with a focus on content discovery. The video feed on the home screen uses vertical swipe gestures for easy navigation.
- Employ subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as video scrolling and like button presses.
